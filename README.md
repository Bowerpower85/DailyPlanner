# DailyPlanner

This application was created to allow the user simple access to a workday planner. The user can save tasks to the planner in timeblocks. These tasked are saved in Local storage and recalled when the page is refreshed. The application also changes color as a way to mark time. When scheduled tasks are in the pask the timeblock turns red to inform them that task is past due if it isn't already done. When a task is in the present the timeblock turns blue to help inform the user that this task should be getting their attention currently. When the saved task is in the future the timeblock turns green so the user knows that the task is still ahead of them it's full steam ahead. Thsi application leverages jquery and javascript. I did want to use a photo in the background but I couldn't figure it out and I knew I needed to work on the MVP so I will try to add some more style later on.
